This repository contains our project for Computação Multimedia subject at FCT, in the year 2021/2022.

This project consists of a dynamic image and video viewer. You select a directory and all the images and video in said directory will be displayed on screen, repositioning and scaling themselves dynamically.

### Building Instructions
1. To build, you will need a copy of [Visual Studio 2019 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/), as well as a copy of [Open Frameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/).
2. Download or clone this repository, and place it inside openFrameworks/apps/myApps.
3. Ensure you install the [ofxCv](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv) addon as well.
4. Run the Visual Studio solution file and compile it.


### Program Usage
1. Upon running the executable, you will be displayed with a black screen and the words `Press CTRL + O to open a directory with images/video`. Press CTRL + O and browse to a folder to open it.
2. If this is the first time opening the folder, it might take a while as the program generates the metadata.
3. Once metadata has been generated/loaded, all the images and video in the directory will appear on the screen, and begin to grow and reposition themselves to fit.
4. You can left click on an image/video to put it into focus, where it will grow and push other files away. Click on another image/video to highlight a different file, or select on empty space to deselect the current image/video.
5. Images can be dragged around by holding left click.
6. If the highlighted object is a video, video playback options will appear if the mouse is currently hovering over the video.
7. On the bottom you have a wide selection of filters which you can apply to the objects.
8. You can right click on an image to open a context menu which will allow you to open the file, or edit and view its metadata.
9. Pressing space bar will pause all physics.
